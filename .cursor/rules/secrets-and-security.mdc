# Secrets & Security

## Secrets

- Store RAPIDAPI_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, HYGRAPH_MUTATION_TOKEN, ADMIN_TOKEN in Netlify environment variables
- Never commit keys or pass to the client

## Auth

- Admin endpoints require the header X-Admin-Token: ${ADMIN_TOKEN}
- Consider IP allow-listing for admin routes
- Rate limit public endpoints

## Data protection

- Avoid sending PII to LLMs
- Redact logs and keep only necessary metadata
- Version results and enable rollback
