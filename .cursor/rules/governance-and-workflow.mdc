# Content Governance & Workflow

## Roles

- Research Runner: triggers research and analysis
- SEO Reviewer: reviews suggestions, requests edits
- Approver: approves to publish/apply

## Workflow stages

1. Research: run Semrush + LLM → draft JSON stored with `status: draft`.
2. Review: Admin UI diffs vs current meta/content; inline edits allowed.
3. Approval: set `status: approved` and publish to `seo/{route}/latest.json`.
4. Apply changes:
   - Runtime: immediately used by `Seo` for meta and JSON-LD.
   - Source: open a Git PR to update `src/data/*` for durable content changes.

## PR contents (when applying to source)

- Update titles, headings, FAQs, and alt text in relevant `src/data/*.ts` entries.
- Include reference to run ID and diff summary in PR description.

## Safeguards

- Limit changes per run (e.g., top 5 routes) to control risk.
- Enforce max/min lengths (title 50–60 chars, meta 140–160 chars).
- Validate links and image paths exist before applying.

## Observability

- Store run logs (timestamp, seeds, model, cost, status) in Blobs/KV.
- Keep last N versions per route for rollback.
