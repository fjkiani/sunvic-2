# Semrush Field Guide

Common fields from the RapidAPI Semrush Keyword Magic Tool (question keywords) and how we interpret them:

- keyword/query/text: The keyword string; for this endpoint typically a question phrase.
- search_volume/volume/searchVolume: Estimated average monthly searches.
- keyword_difficulty/kd/keywordDifficulty: Difficulty to rank (0–100).
- cpc/costPerClick: Average cost-per-click (USD).
- competition/comp/competitiveDensity: Paid competition density (0–1 or 0–100).
- intents/intent: Searcher intent labels (informational, navigational, transactional, commercial).
- serp_features/serpFeatures: SERP features present (e.g., PeopleAlsoAsk, FeaturedSnippet, LocalPack).
- country/locale/cc: Country/locale code for the dataset.

We normalize to:

```json
{
  "keyword": "string",
  "search_volume": 1234,
  "keyword_difficulty": 47,
  "cpc": 2.35,
  "competition": 0.6,
  "intents": ["informational"],
  "serp_features": ["PeopleAlsoAsk"],
  "locale": "us"
}
```

Notes:
- Missing or non-numeric values are omitted.
- Arrays may come as comma-separated strings; we coerce to arrays.
- Paid competition scale varies by source; treat relative values consistently in scoring.
