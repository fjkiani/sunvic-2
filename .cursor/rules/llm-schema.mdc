# LLM Prompt + Output Schema

Standardize the LLM output to strict JSON for reliable automation.

## System prompt

"You are an expert SEO strategist for a general contractor. Given keyword research data and company context, produce actionable, compliant, and locally optimized on-page SEO and content suggestions. Output ONLY valid JSON conforming to the provided schema."

## JSON schema (per route)

```json
{
  "route": "/services",
  "primary_keyword": "kitchen remodeling seattle",
  "secondary_keywords": ["bathroom renovation seattle", "home remodel near me"],
  "title": "Kitchen Remodeling in Seattle | SunVic Construction",
  "meta_description": "Licensed contractors for kitchen and bath remodels in Seattle. Free consultation.",
  "h1": "Seattle Kitchen Remodeling & Renovation",
  "h2s": ["End‑to‑end design & build", "Transparent pricing", "Our recent projects"],
  "content_outline": [
    { "section": "Intro", "bullets": ["Local expertise", "Licensed & insured"] },
    { "section": "Process", "bullets": ["Design", "Permits", "Build"] }
  ],
  "faqs": [
    { "q": "How long does a kitchen remodel take?", "a": "Typical timelines are 6–10 weeks depending on scope." }
  ],
  "schema_jsonld": { "@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "Service", "areaServed": "Seattle" },
  "internal_links": [{ "from": "/services", "to": "/portfolio", "anchor": "See our portfolio" }],
  "image_alts": [{ "image_path": "/images/projects/kitchen/1.png", "alt": "Modern Seattle kitchen remodel with white cabinets" }],
  "source": {
    "seed_keyword": "kitchen remodel",
    "country": "us",
    "model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
    "prompt_version": "v1"
  }
}
```

## Company context

Provide a brief, updatable company profile to the LLM: service areas, specialties, differentiators, tone of voice, and compliance constraints. Keep within token budget and reference by version in `source.prompt_version`.

## Validation

- Validate JSON with a schema before storing.
- Reject responses with hallucinated geographies or services we do not offer.
