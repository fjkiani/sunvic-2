# Scheduling, Caching, and Cost Controls

## Cadence

- Weekly scheduled run for core routes and services
- Monthly deeper refresh for long-tail topics
- Ad-hoc runs allowed via Admin UI with scope limits

## Caching

- Cache RapidAPI responses by `seed|country|ttl(7d)`
- Store hash of keyword dataset; only re-analyze when hash changes
- Deduplicate route analyses by content fingerprint

## Cost controls

- Use small LLM for clustering and draft generation; upscale only for final copy
- Hard caps per run (max routes, max tokens) and global daily cap

## Observability

- Track time, tokens, and vendor cost per run and per route
- Alert when anomalies or large diffs appear
