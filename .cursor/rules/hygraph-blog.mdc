# Hygraph Blog Integration

We will use Hygraph as the CMS for blog posts, with auto-draft creation based on SEO research.

## Hygraph model (example)

- `Post` content type:
  - `title` (String)
  - `slug` (Unique)
  - `excerpt` (String)
  - `content` (Rich Text or Markdown)
  - `coverImage` (Asset)
  - `tags` (List<String>)
  - `status` (Draft/Published)
  - `seoTitle`, `seoDescription` (String)
  - `jsonLd` (JSON)

## Functions

- `blog-generate` (POST):
  - Inputs: `{ topic, routeKey?, keywordData?, companyContext? }`
  - LLM produces: outline, title options, meta, FAQ, internal links
  - Creates a Hygraph draft via GraphQL Mutation using `HYGRAPH_MUTATION_TOKEN`

- `blog-schedule` (Scheduled):
  - Picks candidates from weekly research clusters and company knowledge base
  - Auto-creates drafts with `status: Draft` and assigns tags

## Company knowledge base

- Maintain a compact JSON profile of services, locations, case studies, and tone
- Inject into prompts so posts align with brand and offerings

## Frontend

- A `/blog` list page and `/blog/:slug` detail page that fetch from Hygraph (published only)
- Use `Seo` component; prefer Hygraph `seoTitle`/`seoDescription` when present

## Safety & review

- Drafts require human review before publish
- Validate claims and avoid regulated content issues; include disclaimers if needed
